			In the spring of 2015, I chose to take a leap in a new direction and
			immerse myself in learning full stack web development. I attended the
			coding bootcamp Tech Talent South as well as Gwinnett Technical College
			for a degree in web development. Since then, I have fully immersed
			myself in the Atlanta tech community attending meetups, conferences as
			well as hackathons to grow as a developer. I’ve won first place two
			years in a row at the SkillsUSA state level, in web design, and competed
			at the national level. I’ve worked with Manning Publications to help
			review many of their books/videos on the latest technology trends. I
			continue to work to stay up to date with the latest technologies by
			using such resources as Team Treehouse and Udemy. My casual interest
			in web development has now become a guiding passion and I am excited
			to bring that passion to my next pursuit.

			The experience I have earned in the Marine Corps and C.I.A. has awarded
			me confidence and ability to be successful in any field. I’ve proven an
			ability to work well under pressure when I had three months to prepare
			40 Marines for a deployment to Camp Fallujah, Iraq. I’ve demonstrated
			communication skills was when I had to write a new convoy operations
			manual for the unit I served with in Afghanistan as well as giving 79
			convoy briefs in Iraq. My ability to plan has been established when I
			planned 15 convoys across South Korea moving over 1,000 pieces of decking,
			tents and aircraft equipment.

			I love meeting new people and inspiring innovative digital solutions,
			so feel free to send me an invite; I’d love to connect with you.
